            <h2>Drifting the Wild Fundamental Salmon Waterway</h2>
            <p>Settled somewhere down in the Straightforward Church Wild of No Return winds the Salmon stream. 
                The Focal Idaho Wild Demonstration of 1980, as well as laying out the Stream of No Return Wild (renamed the Straight to the point Church - Waterway of No Return Wild in 1984), changed the Wild and Picturesque Streams Act to incorporate the 79-mile segment of the Salmon
                 Waterway from Corn Spring Camping area to Long Tom Bar as a Wild Stream.
            </p>
            </p>
               The Wild fragment of the Salmon Stream is situated in Focal Idaho and starts at Corn Brook Camping area, 46 miles west of North Fork, Idaho. It streams 79 miles west to Long Tom Bar, which is 28 miles east of Riggins, Idaho. The upper area goes through the Straightforward Church - Stream of No Bring Wild back. The lower area frames the southern limit of the Gospel Mound Wild.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each year, approximately 10,000 people float the Wild section of the Main Salmon River. Depending on water flow levels, the Wild section of the Main Salmon provides a moderate to fast-paced whitewater floating experience.
